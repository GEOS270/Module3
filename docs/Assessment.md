### Written Answers 

Written answers can be brief but they should adequately answer the question.

* Bullet point format is okay **unless otherwise specified**

### File Submissions

Map/charts/figures will be evaluated for completeness and aesthetics.

* Files should be saved as using the file type specified (.pdf, .png, etc.)
    * Make sure to double check the file before uploading!
