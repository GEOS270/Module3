# What is Data?

Before we think about how we represent data in a GIS specifically, we need to take a step back and think about what data is?

<div style="overflow: hidden;
  padding-top: 56.25%;
  position: relative">
  <iframe src="content/WhatIsData.html" title="Processes" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"
    style="border: 0;
   height: 100%;
   left: 0;
   position: absolute;
   top: 0;
   width: 100%;">

* Data is information describing some phenomenon.

* The **type of phenomenon** being represented will often influence *how* we represent it.

* There are different types of data too.  Some is numeric, some is purely descriptive.  Different types of data have different rules we must consider when working with them.

* Spatial data is special!  There are unique considerations we need to make.
