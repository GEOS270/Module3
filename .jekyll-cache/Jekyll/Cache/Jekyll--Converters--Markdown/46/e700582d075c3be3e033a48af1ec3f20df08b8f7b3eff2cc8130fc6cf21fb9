<h3 id="wc1---10-pts"><a href="Content_Part2.md#qc1">WC1</a> - 10 pts</h3>
<p>Briefly, explain the differences between Supervised and Unsupervised classification methods.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>With supervised classification, the user either explicitly defines the class boundaries, or provides a training dataset with defined classes and has the system learn the boundaries.  When we define the classes, sometimes were at risk for inducing our own bias.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With unsupervised classification, the user <em>generally</em> picks the number of classes (some advanced methods can do this this part too, but I don’t expect them to mention that) and then the system defines the classes from there. - Not truly “unsupervised” because its not like the computer just spontaneously classifies things, we have to initiate and guide the process.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="application-1">Application</h2>

<h3 id="wa1---10pts"><a href="Application_Part1.md#wa1">WA1</a> - 10pts</h3>
<p>Do you think this kind of information (locations of restaurants, groceries, etc.) might be helpful when studying the cost of food in a region?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m looking for them to say something involving critical thought - ie. proximity to groceries (&gt;travel distance = &gt;cost$), &gt;#groceries = &gt;choice, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="wa2---10pts"><a href="Application_Part1.md#wa2">WA2</a> - 10pts</h3>
<p>Which projection did are choose for the feature dataset?  Why did I choose this projection?</p>

<p>-BC Albers Equal Area - Equal Area because we’re calculating <strong>Population Dentistry</strong>, BC Albers because its specific to BC</p>

<h3 id="wa3---10pts"><a href="Application_Part2.md#wa3">WA3</a> - 10pts</h3>
<p>Skim the Introduction of the <a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/subjects/standard/pcrac/2016/introduction">Documentation</a> explaining the classification scheme.  What was the reasoning behind updating from the old Rural/Urban method?</p>

<ul>
  <li>The old urban class treated a small town of 1000 the same as a city of 1,000,000 - they needed a finer resolution classification because 2 groups was insufficient to distinguish given the scale of difference.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="wa4---10pts"><a href="Application_Part3.md#wa4">WA4</a> - 10pts</h3>
<p>Create Scatter Plot with Population Density on the X-Axis and Income_on_Food on the Y axis.  Does the r2 score indicate a relationship?  How does classifying the data help us reveal patterns in the data we cant easily see in the scatter plot?</p>

<ul>
  <li>The scatterplot does not show a strong relationshp.  Classifiying the highlights the relationship better, by specifically grouping census subdivisions using two factors: total population <strong>and</strong> population density.  It allows us to see that cities have a close spread in the same range.  It also shows that while not all rurlal area are impacted by food affordability issues, all of the worst affected areas <strong>are</strong> rural.</li>
