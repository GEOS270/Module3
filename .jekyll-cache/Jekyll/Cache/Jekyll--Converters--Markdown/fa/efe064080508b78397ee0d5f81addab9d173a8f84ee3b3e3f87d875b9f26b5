<p>Data classification and visualization are important because:</p>

<p><strong class="label label-blue">1</strong> We use classification methods find patterns in a dataset.</p>
<ul>
  <li>On their own, many datasets are to complex to interpret directly.  We often need to simplify our data by aggregating it into classes (groups).</li>
  <li>This helps us find patterns in our data <strong>and</strong> helps us convey those patterns to others.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong class="label label-blue">2</strong> Data visualization is essential for conveying our results to others effectively.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your analysis is meaningless if you are the only one who understands it.</li>
  <li>We have to be able to share our analyses with others in a concise and organized way.</li>
</ul>
