# Data Visualization and Classification

Data classification and visualization are important because:

**1**{: .label .label-blue } We use classification methods find patterns in a dataset.
* On their own, many datasets are to complex to interpret directly.  We often need to simplify our data by aggregating it into classes (groups).
* This helps us find patterns in our data **and** helps us convey those patterns to others.

**2**{: .label .label-blue } Data visualization is essential for conveying our results to others effectively.
* Your analysis is meaningless if you are the only one who understands it.
* We have to be able to share our analyses with others in a concise and organized way.
