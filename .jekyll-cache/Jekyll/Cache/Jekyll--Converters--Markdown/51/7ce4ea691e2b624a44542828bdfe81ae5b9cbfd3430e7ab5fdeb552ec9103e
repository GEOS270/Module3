<p><a href="Application_Part1.md#importing-the-census-data"><strong>1</strong></a>
Which projection did we choose for the <strong>BC_Census_Data</strong> feature dataset and why?  Why canâ€™t we just work with the simply analytics data as is?</p>

<p><a href="Application_Part1.md#clip-the-bc_census_data-layer"><strong>2</strong></a>
We used the clip tool to ensure we donâ€™t  <em>__</em> population density in the coastal Subdivisions.</p>

<p><a href="Application_Part2.md#a-revised-classification"><strong>3</strong></a>
What was the reasoning behind Stats Canada updating from the old Rural/Urban to the Population Centre and Rural Area classification method?</p>

<p><a href="Application_Part2.md#applying-the-classification"><strong>4</strong></a>
The Select by <em>__</em> tool lets us use SQL (Structured Query Language) to define expressions for querying vector data.</p>

What measurement scale would. <a href="docs/content/WhatIsData.html#/18">Hint</a></p>

<p><a href="Application_Part3.md#plotting-relationships"><strong>5</strong></a>
Box plots are most useful for looking at frequency distributions. [T/F]</p>

<p><a href="Application_Part3.md#plotting-relationships"><strong>20</strong></a>
In which Population Centre and Rural Area class does the the largest proportion of BCâ€™s population live?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Large Urban Population Centre</li>
  <li>Rural</li>
  <li>Small Population Centre</li>
  <li>Medium Population Centre</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="Application_Part3.md#plotting-relationships"><strong>21</strong></a>
What  percent  of BCâ€™s overall population lives in Rural Areas?  Round your answer to the nearest percent.  <em>Hint</em> Sum the four classes to get the total population.</p>

What is the median value for the percentage of income that people in Rural areas spend on food?  Round to the nearest tenth percent.</p>

<p><a href="Application_Part3.md#benefits-of-data-classification"><strong>23</strong></a>
How does classifying the data help us reveal patterns compared to what we see in the scatter plot?  Does the r2 score indicate a relationship in the scatter plot?  What conclusions can you draw about the proportion of income spent on food by people in different regions from looking at the box plot?</p>

<!-- # Lecture Content Questions 

[**1**](Content_Part1.md)
Which type of visualization would be *best suited* to look at a frequency distribution?

- Scatter plot
- Pie chart
- Histogram
- Bar chart
- Box plot
- Line plot
- Cartogram

[**2**](Content_Part1.md)
When a histogram shows a long tail with a handful of outliers, we say the distribution is skewed because deviates from the _______ distribution.

[**3**](Content_Part1.md)
Which unsupervised map classification method in ArcGIS Pro will usually provide you with the best results?

- Defined interval
- Equal interval
- Natural breaks
- Manual breaks

[**4**](Content_Part1.md)
Supervised classification methods are always better than unsupervised because humans are smarter than computers. [T/F]


[**5**](Content_Part1.md)
Unsupervised classification methods require no input from the user, the computer does all the work. [T/F]

[**6**](Content_Part2.md)
Briefly, explain the differences between Supervised and Unsupervised classification methods.

[**7**](Content_Part1.md)
Random forests require a user to provide _______ classes.

[**8**](Content_Part2.md)
It is important to avoid using sequential color pallets or graduated symbols for _____ data because they can imply a ranking/direction, even though this type of data has no rank/direction.

[**9**](Content_Part2.md)
Diverging color maps are great for showing deviations from a mean value. [T/F]

[**10**](Content_Part2.md)
Sequential color maps use gradations of different shades (light/dark) of the same color. [T/F]

[**11**](Content_Part2.md)
The best maps pack the most amount of information into the least amount of space. [T/F]

[**12**](Content_Part2.md)
Every map should always have a north arrow. [T/F]

[**13**](Content_Part2.md)
This type of colorblindness impacts ~ 4.5% of the human population.
