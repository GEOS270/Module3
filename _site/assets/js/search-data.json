TOC {:toc} --- # Research Question There are distinct social, political, and economic differences between Urban and Rural communities in BC. Today we are going to investigate if there is a difference in the cost of food in Rural and Urban areas. Specifically, portion of their income people spend on food. We are going to define Rural and Urban based on two criteria: **total population** and **population density**. # Workflow 1) Download the BC boundary file and Canadian Census Data * I am providing you will a boundary file for BC, you'll see it linked on the next page. * Use Simply Analytics to query and download Canadian Census data. 2) Project setup and pre-processing * Create a project * Use a feature dataset to make sure your data is projected correctly 3) Classify Data * Use the Updated Stats Canada urban/rural classification scheme 4) Visualize Data * Create charts to display your results ",

    "content": "# Data Classification {: .no_toc } 1. TOC {:toc} # Defining Rural & Urban Areas Until 2010, Statistics Canada used a Rural/Urban classification scheme to describe Census unit smaller than a Province/Territory: **Rural**: a population density less than 400 people per square kilometer **or** a total population of less than 1,000 people. **Urban**: a unit with a population density at least 400 people per square kilometer **and** a total population of at least 1,000 people. ## A Revised Classification Statistics Canada Now uses the **Population Center and Rural Area Classification**. You can skim the [Documentation](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/subjects/standard/pcrac/2016/introduction) explaining the classification scheme to get a feel for the reasoning behind updating from the old Rural/Urban method? The new classification scheme was updated to split the old **Urban** class into three different kinds of **Population Centers**: |**Rural** |**Small Population Centers** |**Medium Population Center** |**Large Urban Population Center** |------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|Same as old method|Not Rural **and**Population Population >= 30,000 **and**Population Population >= 100,000| --- # Applying the Classification Your task is to apply the **Population Center and Rural Area Classification** scheme (see table above). You can watch the video below for reference, which shows you how to apply the old **Urban/Rural** scheme. ## **Note** {: .no_toc } * The video is from a slightly dated version of the lab, the steps are the same but some of the file names may look a bit different, and it was recorded using an older version of ArcGIS Pro. * You do not need to apply the old classification scheme, I use this example as a reference. All your answers and uploads for the lab should be drawn from the **New** classification scheme. The general steps for classifying the data are: **1**{: .label .label-red } Calculate population density. * You can refer to the exercise we did as part of [Module 2](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/map-projections/content/exercise4-pop-density.html) for help. **2**{: .label .label-red } Create a field and populate it using select by attribute, following the **Population Center and Rural Area Classification** scheme. * You can reference the table above for pointers on how to formulate your SQL statements.

The file submissions should also be saved as .pdf and uploaded as a separate document. **Written answers can be as brief as you want as long as they answer the question.** ## Content ### [WC1](Content_Part2.md#qc1) - 10 pts Briefly, explain the differences between Supervised and Unsupervised classification methods. - With supervised classification, the user either explicitly defines the class boundaries, or provides a training dataset with defined classes and has the system learn the boundaries. When we define the classes, sometimes were at risk for inducing our own bias. - With unsupervised classification, the user *generally* picks the number of classes (some advanced methods can do this this part too, but I don't expect them to mention that) and then the system defines the classes from there. - Not truly \"unsupervised\" because its not like the computer just spontaneously classifies things, we have to initiate and guide the process. --- ## Application ### [WA1](Application_Part1.md#wa1) - 10pts Do you think this kind of information (locations of restaurants, groceries, etc.) might be helpful when studying the cost of food in a region? - I'm looking for them to say something involving critical thought - ie. proximity to groceries (>travel distance = >cost$), >#groceries = >choice, etc. ### [WA2](Application_Part1.md#wa2) - 10pts Which projection did are choose for the feature dataset? Why did I choose this projection? -BC Albers Equal Area - Equal Area because we're calculating **Population Dentistry**, BC Albers because its specific to BC ### [WA3](Application_Part2.md#wa3) - 10pts Skim the Introduction of the [Documentation](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/subjects/standard/pcrac/2016/introduction) explaining the classification scheme. What was the reasoning behind updating from the old Rural/Urban method? - The old urban class treated a small town of 1000 the same as a city of 1,000,000 - they needed a finer resolution classification because 2 groups was insufficient to distinguish given the scale of difference. ### [WA4](Application_Part3.md#wa4) - 10pts Create Scatter Plot with Population Density on the X-Axis and Income_on_Food on the Y axis. Does the r2 score indicate a relationship? How does classifying the data help us reveal patterns in the data we cant easily see in the scatter plot? - The scatterplot does not show a strong relationshp. Classifiying the highlights the relationship better, by specifically grouping census subdivisions using two factors: total population **and** population density. It allows us to see that cities have a close spread in the same range. It also shows that while not all rurlal area are impacted by food affordability issues, all of the worst affected areas **are** rural. --- ## File Submissions ### [FA1](Application_Part3.md#fa1) - 10pts each (20pts total) Submit your Bar Chart and Box Plot to Canvas. - Must use colorscheme that is red-green colorblind friendly [see this video for reference on what I've told them](https://youtu.be/3Kf0Ng3ZVBs?t=687) **&** suitable for qualitative data (not a sequential colormap) - Should have meaningful concise labels (edit out underscores, etc.) & generally be aesthetically pleasing. # Rubric All written answers and file submissions will be scored using this generic rubric.

Nearly everything we are interested in studying in the natural and social sciences has some temporal element to it. Most GIS data have both a spatial and temporal component to them. Spatial data is “special” because of its natural tendencies (e.g., Tobler’s Law, autocorrelation, & natural clustering), similar processes also effect temporal data. ## Static vs. Dynamic Phenomena that do not change over time are said to be **static**. These features only need to be collected once and remain the same unless changed by an outside force. Nothing in the universe is truly static, but on human timescales, things like mountains and continents be considered static. Phenomena that change constantly over time are said to be **dynamic**. These features must be captured often at a level commensurate with the temporal scale you are using. Forest fires are extremely dynamic, changing on timescales of hours. Other phenomena generally move more slowly, like the spread of an invasive plant species or changes in human populations. ### Series of Static Maps These are just a small number of maps usually collected at regular intervals such as years or decades to show changes over time Strengths: Ideal for printed form Work well with a small (3-6) number of “slices” Weaknesses: Not good for large number of slices (> 10) May not clearly demonstrate subtle changes between slices over longer periods of time ### Animated Maps In simplest form, just showing static maps one after another Strengths: Good for web resources Can work well with short or medium time period focused on one area Weaknesses: Do not work in print Does not work well for subtle changes over large geographic areas ### Dynamic Maps Allowing users to zoom in or out to interact with the data. **Strengths**: Ideal for web based applications. Can incorporate many different data sources that can be turned on and off by the user. **Weaknesses**: Do not work in print, requre an internet connection, can be difficult to use.
